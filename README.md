This project is a StackOverflow clone with basic features, including user authentication, question creation, answering, image uploading, and voting. The frontend is developed using Angular, and the backend is built with Spring Boot. JWT is used for security.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (for Angular)
- Java 8 or higher
- Maven

### Frontend (Angular)

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

   The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:4200/`.

### Backend (Spring Boot)

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Set up your MySQL database and update the `application.properties` file with the database configuration.

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Run the Spring Boot application:

   ```bash
   java -jar target/stackoverflow-clone.jar
   ```

   The backend will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080/`.
